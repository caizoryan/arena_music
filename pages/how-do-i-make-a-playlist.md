1. To make a playlist you will need an [Are.na](https://are.na) Account. If you don't have one, you might want to get started by [signing up](https://www.are.na/sign_up) for one.
2. Once you have an Are.na account, [make a channel.](https://help.are.na/docs/getting-started/channels)
3. Once you've made a channel, add your songs of choice as a youtube link or mp3 files to that channel. [Here's how you can add blocks.](https://help.are.na/docs/getting-started/blocks/adding-blocks)
4. Once your playlist is complete copy the link of the channel and paste it in the text box.
5. Voila, done!
