# How do I make a playlist?
---
1. To make a playlist you will need an [Are.na](https://are.na) Account. If you don't have one, you might want to get started by [signing up](https://www.are.na/sign_up) for one
2. Once you have an Are.na account, [make a channel](https://help.are.na/docs/getting-started/channels)
3. After you make a channel you can add either mp3 files or youtube links as blocks onto the channel. [Here's how you can add blocks](https://help.are.na/docs/getting-started/blocks/adding-blocks) 
4. Once your playlist is complete copy the link of the channel and [paste it here]() or [search for your channel here]()
5. Voila, done!
