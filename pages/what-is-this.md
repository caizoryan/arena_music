# What is this
---
This is a bootleg version of [mac.are.na](https://mac.are.na/). This website will turn are.na channel's with youtube links, and mp3 files into playlists you can listen to.

### What is mac.are.na
mac.are.na is a music player that turns [are.na](https://are.na) channel's with youtube, soundcloud links and mp3 files into playlist. 

### Does this player differ from mac.are.na? How so?
Yes. The major difference is that this player has a css editor that affords you the ability to edit css styles of how the player displays a channel. So you can customize and decorate a playlist/album and gift it to someone. It also can't play soundcloud links yet. You can find [some examples here]()

### Why do this?
To try and enact alternative means of circulation beyond centralized platforms.
